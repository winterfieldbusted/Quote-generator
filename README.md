This project is a simple yet functional Quote Generator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application displays a random quote each time the user clicks the "I'm feeling lucky" button.

Key Features:

Random Quote Generation: The JavaScript code randomly selects a quote from a predefined array of motivational and thought-provoking quotes. The generator ensures that each quote is displayed only once until all quotes have been shown, after which the cycle resets.

User Interface: The interface is minimalistic and user-friendly, featuring a centered title and quote display area, with a button that prompts the quote generation.
Responsive Design: The layout is designed to be centered and aesthetically pleasing on different screen sizes, thanks to CSS styling.

Technologies Used:

HTML: Provides the structure of the webpage.

CSS: Adds style to the elements, centering content and giving the button a sleek, modern look.

JavaScript: Handles the logic for random quote generation and ensures that no quote repeats until all have been displayed.

This project serves as a great starting point for learning how to manipulate the DOM using JavaScript and offers a practical example of how to combine HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create interactive web applications.
